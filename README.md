# SemVal-Task-2025

This repository contains resources and instructions for the second assignment in the Practical Data Science course. The scope of the assignment is to participate in the [Food Hazard Detection Challenge](https://food-hazard-detection-semeval-2025.github.io/ "link"), where participants analyze provided datasets to identify food hazards. The assignment involves performing benchmark analyses on both short texts (titles) and long texts (texts) using machine learning algorithms and evaluating the results.


## Assignment Task

The task is to apply and evaluate traditional and advanced machine learning algorithms for the four classification tasks of which the challenge consists, using the provided short and long texts.

**Classification Tasks**
- Detect hazard category
- Detect product category
- Detect hazard vector
- Detect product vector
