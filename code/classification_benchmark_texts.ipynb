Then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product). Sometimes foods have to be withdrawn or recalled if there is a risk to consumers because the allergy labelling is missing or incorrect or if there is any other food allergy risk. When there is a food allergy risk, the FSA will issue an Allergy Alert.

Even though Garden of Life routinely performs pathogen testing on every finished good lot to ensure safety and no product has ever tested positive for the presence of Salmonella, the company felt it was in the public's best interest to take this voluntary action. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. FDA is investigating illnesses.\\nEvery lot tested negative for the presence of Salmonella prior to release to the market. Raw Meal products are distributed throughout the United States and sold at better health food stores and natural grocers.\\nConsumers who believe they may have a Raw Meal product affected by this recall, should look for the following lot codes prominently stamped on the underside of the plastic container. The following is the list of lots affected:\\n\\u201cIn an overabundance of caution we are taking this extreme measure because we want to ensure that you never have to wonder about the purity of any Raw Meal product.\\u201d said Brian Ray, President of Garden of Life.\\nAny Raw Meal product from a lot code not listed above is entirely safe and not affected by this recall. All Garden of Life, LLC's products are manufactured in the United States at FDA and NSF audited facilities, in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. No Garden of Life product has ever tested positive for salmonella.\\nIf, however, a consumer has purchased a product from any of the lot codes listed above and wishes to return it, they should return the unused portion of the product to the place of purchase for a full refund. Questions may be directed to the company at 1-866-465-0051, Monday-Friday between the hours of 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM EST.\\n \\n  \\n  PRODUCT NAME \\n  Lot Number \\n  Exp Date \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal 10 CNT Tray \\n  47214800 \\n  9/12017 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Full Size \\n  47198800 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Full Size \\n  47214600 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Chai Full Size \\n  47215500 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Chai Full Size \\n  47215501 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Full Size \\n  47216100 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Full Size \\n  47225500 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Full Size \\n  47225900 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Full Size \\n  47249200 \\n  9/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Chai 10 CNT Tray \\n  47183201 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Full Size \\n  47198601 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Chai Half Size \\n  47206000 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Full Size \\n  47225600 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Half Size \\n  47225800 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Half Size \\n  47226200 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Half Size \\n  47226400 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Full Size \\n  47236000 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla 10 CNT Tray \\n  47248000 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Full Size \\n  47248901 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Full Size \\n  47253900 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Half Size \\n  47257401 \\n  9/30/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Full Size \\n  47226000 \\n  10/1/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Full Size \\n  47216200 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Full Size \\n  47225601 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Full Size \\n  47226100 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Half Size \\n  47226201 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Chai Full Size \\n  47226300 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Full Size \\n  47246500 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Vanilla Chai Full Size \\n  47247600 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n  \\n  RAW Organic Meal Chocolate Half Size \\n  47247800 \\n  10/31/17 \\n  \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hazard_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"allergens\",\n          \"biological\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cereals and bakery products\",\n          \"dietetic foods, food supplements, fortified foods\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hazard\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sesame seeds and products thereof\",\n          \"salmonella\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"product\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"bakery products\",\n          \"dietary supplement\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This is probably because it has a lower standard deviation than XGBoost even though it has a better mean and also because in the BERT model i did not apply cross-validation as i did in the others (due to computational resources) and the f1 macro seems to be a bit optimistic (that's why i wrote \"approximate\").\n",

Probably to work better a good approach is to use oversampling and undersampling to increase the visibility of the minority labels and decrease the visibility of the majority labels accordingly.

The BERT model as in the hazard vector classification task could not be fitted for the same reason."
